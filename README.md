This is a YouTube browser application built in React.

It makes a request over to the YouTube API. It does a search for a list of videos matching a search term, and show the videos on the right hand side of the screen.

A user can then click on one of these videos and can click on a play button and play the video. It will also show them a title and a description of the video.
